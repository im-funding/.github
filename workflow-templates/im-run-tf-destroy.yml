# Workflow Code: HostileMacaw_v3    DO NOT REMOVE
# Purpose:
#    Destroys all the remote objects for a terraform configuration when someone kicks it off manually.
#
# Frequency:
#    - This workflow should only be used once per repository
#
# Projects to use this Template with:
#    -  Terraform (Optional Template)
#
# TODO Prerequisites
#    - Ensure each of the repo-level and env-level secrets used in this workflow have been populated by an admin in your repository.
