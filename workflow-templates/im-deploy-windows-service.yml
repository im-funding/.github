# Workflow Code: MaterialVolcano_v10    DO NOT REMOVE

# Note: Each deployable on-prem service in the repository should have their own copy of this workflow rather than trying to deploy several
#       on-prem service with the same workflow.  If the service is deployed as part of a group, the service still needs its own copy of this
#       workflow but it will be streamlined (instructions below) since the Deploy Multiple Items workflow handles many of these checks.

# Prerequisites
# 1 - Make sure the Service account secrets have been added to the environment
# 2 - Make sure the host windows server has been prepped to accept incoming WinRM Requests

# TODO: Ensure each of the repo-level and env-level secrets used in this workflow have been populated by an admin in your repository.
# TODO: Set up a deployment board if it does not already exist: https://github.com/im-practices/git-er-done/blob/main/actions/deployment-board.md
#       Generally one board should be set up per windows service in the repository.

# TODO:  If there are multiple on prem services in the repo, append the service name to this workflow's file name and update the workflow name below
name: Deploy On Prem Windows Service

  # TODO: If the repository has a single deployable artifact or multiple deployables that are deployed independently:

  # TODO: If a repository has multiple deployable artifacts that are deployed together through the 'Deploy Multiple Items' workflow:
  #       1. Uncomment the repository_dispatch trigger

  #       3. Change the env.RELEASE_TAG value from "${{ github.event.inputs.tag }}" to: "${{ github.event.client_payload.tag }}"
  #       4. Under the 'set-vars' job:
  #          a. Change the outputs.ENVIRONMENT value from "${{ steps.clean-env.outputs.ENVIRONMENT }}" to "${{ github.event.client_payload.environment }}"
  #          b. Delete the 'Checkout Repository' step
  #          c. Delete the 'Verify Tag Exists' step
  #          d. Delete the 'Set ENVIRONMENT' step
  #          e. Change the echo statement to use "${{ github.event.client_payload.environment }}" when printing the environment
